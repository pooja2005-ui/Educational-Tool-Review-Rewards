Educational Tool Review Rewards

## Project Description:
The **Educational Tool Review Rewards** platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that rewards users for submitting valuable reviews about educational tools or apps. Users can submit reviews, and once approved, they are rewarded with a set amount of tokens (or Ether in this case). This incentivizes users to provide feedback and helps other users make informed decisions when choosing educational apps or tools.

## Contract Address:
0xc11882713dfc77b0d8507e4eb0435e632f5eedcd

## Project Vision:
The platform aims to foster community-driven reviews of educational tools and apps, incentivizing users to engage and contribute to the platform by sharing their experiences. This ecosystem ensures that high-quality, verified reviews get rewarded, and it promotes transparency and trust in the educational app marketplace.

The project envisions a world where users can participate in the growth and improvement of educational tools while being rewarded for their efforts. The ultimate goal is to create a space where reviews can drive the adoption of the best educational products, ensuring that the right tools get to the right people.

## Key Features:

1. **Review Submission**: Users can submit reviews for educational tools or apps. The review includes the app name, review text, and timestamp. These reviews are initially unapproved.

2. **Review Approval by Owner**: Only the contract owner can approve reviews. Once approved, the reviewer is rewarded with tokens (or Ether, in this case).

3. **Incentive System**: Each approved review earns the reviewer a fixed reward amount, encouraging active participation and quality feedback. Rewards can be claimed after approval.

4. **Reward Claiming**: Reviewers can claim their accumulated rewards (Ether) after their review is approved by the contract owner. The rewards are transferred to their wallet.

5. **Owner Control**: The contract owner can approve reviews, fund the contract, and update the reward amount. Only the owner has these administrative privileges.

6. **Funding the Contract**: The contract owner can fund the contract with Ether to ensure there are enough funds to reward reviewers. The `fundContract` function allows this.

7. **Update Reward Amount**: The owner can change the reward amount given to reviewers, allowing flexibility in the incentive system.

8. **Simple and Secure**: The contract is simple, transparent, and secure. It uses modifiers to ensure only the owner can perform specific actions and protects users' funds with an easy-to-understand process.

9. **Customizable**: The reward system and contract operations are customizable based on future requirements. It can be extended to support ERC20 tokens, NFT rewards, or even additional user interactions.
